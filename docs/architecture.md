## Architecture

High level structure of the frontend code and the discipline of creating such structures.

+ **[Algorithms](architecture/algorithms.md)**: A self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.
+ **[Design Patterns](architecture/design-patterns.md)**: Best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
+ **[Designs](architecture/designs.md)**: Ready to use and well documented structures and frameworks for frontend development.
+ **[Event-Driven Programming](architecture/event-driven-programming.md)**: Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.
+ **[Functional Programming](architecture/functional-programming.md)**: Functional programming is a programming paradigm, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
+ **[Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)](architecture/functional-reactive-programming-frp.md)**: FRP is a programming paradigm for asynchronous dataflow programming using the building blocks of functional programming.
